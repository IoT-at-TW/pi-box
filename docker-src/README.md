=================
You will need:

1. A Raspberry Pi kernel file, saved as `kernel`. I grabbed one from [a Raspberry Pi kernel repository](https://github.com/dhruvvyas90/qemu-rpi-kernel).
2. A Raspberry Pi image file, saved as `raspbian.img`. I grabbed one from [the Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian).
Just make sure that the kernel is for the correct image (eg. for Raspbian Jessie Lite with kernel version 4.4, use `kernel-qemu-4.4.13-jessie`).
